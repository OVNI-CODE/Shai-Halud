Dear Mr Glixan,
I I'm very sorry to bring you the sad news of the Shai Hulud.

As you know she has been with us for many years serving up randomised <BR>
divinity selections in a discordant manner to the many surfaces and paradise <BR>
seekers roaming the web looking for answers to their questions.

as you may also be aware shai hulud has found a permanent or what seemed to be a <BR>
permanent refuge in the the metadata of synapse New Zealand an organisation <BR>
dedicated to protect the preserve of Shahid Masood.

alas when I went to visit the website a few days ago I discovered that shy Helen's <BR>
flash meta language had finally become redundant... rip MACROMEDIA<BR>
The actionscript had become one with the universe.. <BR>in short shai hulud has 'parsed' away from its html moorings and into the greater surf..

I tried the obvious and most immediate solutions including parse a html file <BR>
in PYTHON and bypassing the action strip. But Aliah! I have found a new solution on which <BR>
we can collaborate it is based on github... and a bastardization of the JavaScript divinity <BR>
randomised answer selector of the still running and finally surviving oracle of professor brainstorm!

You will receive a link in a forth coming email with which we can replace the brain of Dr brainstorm <BR>
with the answers 2020 version of Che halud.. <BR>
The Cuban revolutionary version of the divinity select oracle Twenty20 <BR>
shall be permanently resident on the synapse of New Zealand org

Salutations,
Guardians of the Shai Halud oracle, cyberspace, electrom.
Dr Amit NagaRaja
